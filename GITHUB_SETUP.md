# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Ready to Push to GitHub

Your LINE Stock Bot project is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Here's how:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click **"New repository"** or **"+"** → **"New repository"**
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `line-stock-bot` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Serverless LINE chatbot for stock prices built on Google Cloud Functions`
   - **Visibility**: Public or Private (your choice)
   - **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /c/Users/dougc/git/linebot

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/line-stock-bot.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Verify Upload

After pushing, your GitHub repository will contain:

```
line-stock-bot/
├── 📁 functions/webhook/        # Cloud Function source code
├── 📁 shared/                   # Shared utilities

### 4. Security Notes
